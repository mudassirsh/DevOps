**Kernel**:		
Kernel is the core of operating system. Glue between hardware and application i.e. Linux kernel	![image](https://github.com/mudassirsh/DevOps/assets/18271814/199d8fbb-1e22-439c-bfb2-f014565a9f5e)

Desktop Env:		GUI on the top of the operating system.			GNOME, KDE, Xfce and Fluxbox	are the examples of desktop environments.
Command line:		Interface for typing commands on top of the operating system.


**Shell:**

Linux is a full multitasking multiuser operating system with built-in networking and service processes known as deamons.

BIOS:			     Basic Input/Output System. When computer turned on, it runs the self test called POST (power-on self test). Bios software is stored on a ROM chip on the motherboard.


BootLoader:	That boots the operating syste.  Examples of boot loader GRUB & ISOLinux, dos u-boot . Once the post completed, control went to bootloader. Bootloader is stored on the Hard disk. Bootloader is responsible for loading the Kernel image and initial Ram disk or the file system into memory. Bootloader loads the kernel and the initial ram based file system into memory so it can be used directly by the kernel.

Most of other processes running trace their origin to init
Init is responsible for keeping the system running and for shutting it down cleanly.
